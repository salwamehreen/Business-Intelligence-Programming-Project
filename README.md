# Business-Intelligence-Programming-Project
This repository contains the final project for the **"CST2101 - Business Intelligence Programming"** course, part of the **Business Intelligence Systems Infrastructure** program at Algonquin College of Advanced Technology. It showcases the application of Exploratory Model Analysis and Model Training using Python. 

To complete the project yourself, please download the "diabetes.csv" dataset and run the .ipnyb file using a Jupyter-compatible interface such as Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, etc. You would also need to change the file's path to your specific path.  

Please feel free to provide any constructive feedback, as it will greatly assist me as I continue to navigate my coding journey!
